README
This file describes the contents in this folder and the geometry files
for the KTHand. This file and some of the contents in this folder can
be discarded unless you wish to modify the geometry of the KTHand.

To reduce the complexity of the model and hence improve performance in
GraspIt!, the model is manually created from vertices and triangles,
all manually defined. For the creation of some parts' geometry in iv-format, a
MATLAB script is used to read the points and triangles from two
different files and output a valid iv-file. There is no documentation,
but should be fairly easy to understand for anyone with basic
programming and matlab skills.
